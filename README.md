# coltab
A simple script to display samples of 8-bit colors available in most terminals.
# About
This is just a script I wrote for my own use, but I figured I should put it here as well.
# Installation
1. Download the python file or clone this repository

2. Put the script file in `/usr/local/bin` or anywhere in your `$PATH`

3. Make sure the script have permission to be executed by
   ```
   $ chmod a+x coltab
   ```
   
4. Now you're all set! Try running `$ coltab`, it should run without any problem.

**Note:** I haven't tried running this script on Windows yet. It may or may not work, but if you happen to test it, please let me know.
